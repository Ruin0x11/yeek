# yeek

A tool for analyzing OpenNefia's Lua source code.

The plan is to use this for:

1. Refactoring.
2. Documentation generation, using a superset of LDoc's comment syntax.
3. Detecting breaking changes to APIs/data/events, serializing them, and outputting them in a human readable format, in the same vein as tools like `elm diff`.
